# a_discord_bot

Discord bot written in Python.

The `Procfile` file is for deploying the project to [heroku.com](https://www.heroku.com/).

Highly recommend Heroku for running the Discord bot, instead of [repl.it](https://repl.it/) let's say, as if you add a valid billing address you get 1,000 hours of non-stop runtime for your bot per month.
